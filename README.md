### 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi! I'm Sakshi — a backend developer who loves turning complex problems into clean, maintainable code.

With 3+ years of hands-on experience, I’ve worked across startups and teams to build scalable APIs, secure backend systems, and real-time apps. My happy place is somewhere between terminal commands, clean architecture, and a good cup of chai ☕️.

I’m passionate about:
- Writing meaningful, secure code  
- Working with cloud tools like AWS & Azure  
- Exploring backend design patterns  
- And always learning something new (currently it's Kafka, NestJS, and microservices!)

### 🌟 A Few Projects I'm Proud Of

💼 **Kalon Will – Advisor Portal**  
Built secure, scalable APIs from scratch. Mentored the team, handled reviews, and designed the entire backend flow. This one taught me a lot about leadership and clean architecture.

🏨 **Hotel Booking System**  
Dynamic booking flow with room availability, pricing, discounts, and payment modules. Loved building the core logic that powers it all.

🎓 **AI Interview Platform**  
From video recording to dynamic questions (yes, with some generative AI magic ✨), this system made candidate evaluation smart and smooth.

📢 **Crisis Communication Tool**  
An alert system for emergencies—designed with real-time updates and admin-level control.

🏫 **School Management App**  
Simplified admin tasks, student tracking, and attendance through smart APIs and a well-structured database.
